Please give a relevant answer to the following question. Question: Did the Greeks and the Romans have universities?. Answer: Yes. The Greek Universities were set up at Athens, at Thebes, at Miletus, and at other large places. The term university has its origin in the Greek term u-pos, meaning 'common' or 'civil'. The universities were schools of learning which gave an opportunity, in antiquity, to bring together a cross section of knowledge from different disciplines in order to develop them. A Roman universities were also set up in Rome, as was the so-called University of Rome, with the aim of providing an extensive library with the Greek classics and other subjects. In the 12th century the Roman authorities established the University of Florence in the city of Siena, in Italy, which became the most important of the German universities. In 1487, Pope Innocent III ordered that in every European country a new university should be built. The idea was that, in the future, all of Europe, with the exception of the Mediterranean, should become one intellectual society and every one should be allowed, according to his abilities, to pursue a scientific and pedagogical interest from the universities. At first, most of the Latin and German universities were built but as soon as it became clear that the world would become a more important place, they were also built in Italy and in France and Belgium. The first Universities were established and developed not in the countries of the Far East (most notably Russia, China, Korea, and Japan) but in the old Roman Empire, the old Greek Empire\"}]"
